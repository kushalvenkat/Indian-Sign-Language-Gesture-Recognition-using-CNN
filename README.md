# Indian-Sign-Language-Gesture-Recognition-using-CNN
Steps for Execution
-------------------

Step 1: Install Dependencies

- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system. 
- This typically includes Python, TensorFlow (or Keras), and any other required libraries.
- You can use package managers like pip to install the dependencies.


Step 2: Download the Project Files

- Download and extract the project files to a directory on your local machine. 
- Make sure you have the 'trained.h5' file (model file) in the same directory as the 'main.py' file.
- The dataset must also be present.


Step 3: Prepare the Input

- Prepare the input for the gesture recognition system. 
- This will be a live video stream. 
- For using a live video stream, make sure your webcam is connected and accessible.


Step 4: Execute the Program

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. 
- Run the 'main.py' file using the Python interpreter by executing the following command:
  	---> python main.py 
- This will start the program and initiate the gesture recognition process using the trained model.


Step 5: Interpret the Results

- As the program runs, it will process the input video frames using the trained model. 
- The recognized gestures will be displayed as output, either on the console or in a graphical user interface, depending on how the program is designed.
